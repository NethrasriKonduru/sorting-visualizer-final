# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based application to visualize various sorting algorithms using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with user authentication and real-time algorithm code display.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Color-Coded Animations**: Each sorting step is visually highlighted with distinct colors to make the process easy to understand.
- **Adjustable Array Size**: Modify the number of elements in the array to visualize sorting performance with smaller or larger arrays.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animation for a faster or slower demonstration of the algorithm.
- **Algorithm Code Display**: See the algorithmâ€™s code in real-time alongside the visualization, with the relevant lines of code highlighted during each step of the sorting process.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and access the sorting visualizer, ensuring a personalized experience and secure access.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualizer and the UI are optimized for use on various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can pause, reset, and step through the sorting process to analyze the algorithm's behavior in detail.
- **Detailed Logs**: A real-time log displays the steps taken by the algorithm, providing insight into the internal workings of the sorting process.
- **Customizable UI**: Background images and other design elements are customizable, allowing users to personalize their experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## Future Works

- **Additional Sorting Algorithms**: Integrate more advanced algorithms like Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort to expand the functionality.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a dark mode for a better user experience, particularly in low-light environments.
- **User Profiles**: Enable user profiles to save their sorting preferences and visualizations.
- **Algorithm Performance Metrics**: Show detailed metrics like time complexity, comparisons, and swaps during the sorting process.
- **Optimization Features**: Optimize the visualizations for better performance with large datasets and more complex algorithms.
- **Mobile App Version**: Develop a mobile app version of the Sorting Visualizer for better accessibility on mobile devices.
